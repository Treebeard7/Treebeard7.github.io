    Worked with Matthew Tan to build a self-stabalizing RC plane built from scratch using Raspberry Pi's, RFD900 radios, a 
    BNO05 IMU, and much more fun stuff! This was our final project for CS 107E.

- name: Employment of Catalytic Analysis and Computational Modeling in the Development of a Novel Competitive Inhibitor of Cdc14 Phosphatases in C. zeina
  id: project3
  description: >
    I researched the enzyematic properties of CzCdc14 (a protein in a fungus that ruins crops) to develop an in silico small-molecular 
    inhibitor to it that may serve as the foundation for a future fungicide. Research was conducted at UCSD as part of the Summer Science Program.
