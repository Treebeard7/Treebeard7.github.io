- name: Efficient Blood Pressure Prediction from Photoplethysmography Signals
  id: project6
  description: >
    As my final project for CS 229, I developed a custom preprocessing and encoding pipeline for raw PPG signals 
    from the VitalDB dataset. I then evaluated the performance of various machine learning models to predict blood
    pressure given a single PPG pulse. I achieved results comparable with literature.

- name: Quantifying a Player's Strategic Passing Ability Using PageRank
  id: project5
  description: >
    Created graph networks representing passes between players on La Liga Teams from the entire 2017-18 season. I
    then adapted the PageRank algorithm to quantify a player's strategic passing ability, and compared these results
    to online player rankings.

    Built a self-stabalizing RC plane from scratch using Raspberry Pi's, RFD900 radios, a 
    BNO05 IMU, and much more fun stuff! This was the final project for CS 107E.

- name: Inglacial – A Post-Synchronizing Processing Chain for Bistatic Ice-Penetrating Radar
  id: project2
  description: >
    I worked with graduate student Nicole Bienert in the <a href="https://radioglaciology.com" class="highlighted">Radio-glaciology Lab</a> at Stanford
    to build, test, and use a novel signal processing chain for synchronizing bistatic radar used to study ice-sheets.

- name: Employment of Catalytic Analysis and Computational Modeling in the Development of a Novel Competitive Inhibitor of Cdc14 Phosphatases in C. zeina
  id: project3
  description: >
    I researched the enzyematic properties of CzCdc14 (a protein in a fungus that ruins crops) to develop an in silico small-molecular 
    inhibitor to it that may serve as the foundation for a future fungicide. Research was conducted at UCSD as part of the Summer Science Program.
