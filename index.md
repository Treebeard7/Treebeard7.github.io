### Welcome, I'm Rohan 
I'm an undergraduate student at <a href="https://www.stanford.edu/" class="highlighted">Stanford University</a> studying electrical engineering with minors in computer science and mathematics. I'm interested in furthering my knowledge of fundamental concepts in math and physics to build hardware and software solutions to address climate change and healthcare problems. In addition to my academic interests, I'm a Crystal Palace fan, avid hiker, skier, and bassoonist!
