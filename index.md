### Welcome, I'm Rohan 
I'm a first year undergraduate student at <a href="https://www.stanford.edu/" class="highlighted">Stanford University</a> studying electrical engineering with minors in history and mathematics. Through my projects and coursework, I hope to combine my interests in hardware, software, math, and physics to work on emerging 21st century technologies that benefit the world.Specifically, I'm interested in working on green technology, autonomous flight, and medical devices. In addition to my academic interests, I'm a Crystal Palace fan, avid hiker, skier, and bassoonist!
